## Want to support the core project even more?

That's awesome! As well as the bounty system we also encourage anyone interested to join our Core Developers or Maintainers team.

These roles include tasks like:

- Code reviews
- Code quality improvements
- Devops and general optimisations
- Security and general updates
- Documentation
- Issue management

There is a separate hourly pay scale for these roles, aimed at developers who help a bit more consistently at around 2-3h per week. If you're interested in these roles then feel free to reach out on slack or during the monthly dev call.
