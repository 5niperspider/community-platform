Backend tests are written with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started) and executed against a set of emulators for core services

## Prerequisites

You will need to support the running of [Firebase Emulators](https://firebase.google.com/docs/emulator-suite/install_and_configure#install_the_local_emulator_suite)

## Running Locally

```
yarn workspace functions test:watch
```

This will startup the firebase emulator suite, compile functions, and watch for any changes to function or spec test files

:::info  
The emulator console can be viewd on [localhost:4001](http://localhost:4001). All data will be cleared on script termination
:::

To run just a single test the interactive prompts can be used to provide a matching filename path, e.g.

```sh
$ yarn workspace functions test:watch

$ Watch Usage
> Press p to filter by a filename regex pattern

$ pattern â€º mySpec

```

This will automatically watch for changes to any files that match the regular expression `/mySpec/`

## Writing Tests

Tests are written in [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started), with filenames ending `.spec.ts`

## Utilities and Examples

### Mocking

TODO - share examples of mocking methods to avoid need for full function execution

### Executing Functions Directly

It is possible to directly execute any function within the test environment without its required trigger.
A utility `FirebaseEmulatedTest` class is used to wrap the function invocation so that it can be used async, e.g.

_myFunction.ts_

```ts
import functions from 'firebase-functions'

exports.default = functions.firestore
  .document(`mockEndpoint/{id}`)
  .onUpdate((change) => {
    return doSomething(change)
  })
```

_myFunction.spec.ts_

```ts
import { FirebaseEmulatedTest } from '../test/Firebase/emulator'
import myFunction from './myFunction.ts'

const beforeData = { field: 'initialValue' }
const afterData = { field: 'changedValue' }

const change = FirebaseEmulatedTest.mockFirestoreChangeObject(
  beforeData,
  afterData,
  'mockEndpoint',
  'mockDocId',
)

await FirebaseEmulatedTest.run(myFunction, change)
```

Additional utilities can also be used to provide a mock of the triggering context. In the example above a mock `before` and `after` data snapshot is created to mimic the firestore document change trigger used by the function

### Seed and Teardown Data

The test utilities also have methods for seeding and clearing the Firestore DB if required for tests.

_myFunction.spec.ts_

```ts
beforeEach(async () => {
  await FirebaseEmulatedTest.seedFirestoreDB('users', [{ _id: 'user1 ' }])
})
afterEach(async () => {
  await FirebaseEmulatedTest.clearFirestoreDB()
})
```

:::caution  
If your test function interacts directly with an empty database endpoint it may throw an error  
(various issues on github, should review in the future)
:::

The easiest workaround is to seed the endpoint without any docs, which will allow the emulators to return an empty array from queries.

```
await FirebaseEmulatedTest.seedFirestoreDB('empty_endpoint',[])
```
